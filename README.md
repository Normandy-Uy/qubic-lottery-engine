Qubic Fortress-Class Lottery Engine - Grant Proposal
Project Overview
The Qubic Fortress-Class Charitable Lottery Engine is an innovative blockchain-powered charitable fundraising platform designed primarily for government charity initiatives and aligned with the ethical philosophy of Sergey Ivancheglo (Come-from-Beyond) and the Qubic Foundation. This revolutionary lottery engine leverages Qubic's exceptional 15.5 million transactions per second capability to create transparent, corruption-resistant funding mechanisms for poverty alleviation, education, healthcare, and social welfare programs worldwide.

1. Introduction
The global charitable fundraising sector faces significant challenges with transparency, corruption, and inefficient distribution mechanisms. Traditional lottery systems lack the security, transparency, and global reach necessary for modern charitable initiatives. Our fortress-class lottery engine addresses these challenges by leveraging Qubic blockchain's revolutionary speed and security capabilities to create a transparent, provably fair, and globally accessible charitable fundraising platform.

This project serves dual purposes: demonstrating Qubic's unmatched blockchain performance capabilities to the world while creating sustainable funding mechanisms for charitable causes globally. The 5/50 lottery format with fortress-class security architecture ensures maximum participation while maintaining absolute integrity and transparency.

2. Business Need
Current Market Gaps
Lack of Transparency: Traditional charitable lotteries suffer from opacity in fund distribution and winner selection
Limited Global Reach: Existing systems cannot handle worldwide participation due to technical limitations
Corruption Vulnerabilities: Centralized systems are susceptible to manipulation and fraud
Inefficient Distribution: Manual processes delay charitable fund allocation and increase administrative costs
Poor User Experience: Complex participation processes limit adoption and engagement
Qubic's Competitive Advantage
15.5M TPS vs Ethereum's 15 TPS: Qubic's revolutionary speed enables real-time global participation impossible on other blockchains
Zero Transaction Fees: Unlike Ethereum's high gas costs, Qubic enables micro-transactions suitable for charitable giving
Instant Finality: Immediate transaction confirmation ensures real-time lottery operations
Native Random Number Generation: Built-in provably fair randomness eliminates external oracle dependencies
Energy Efficiency: Sustainable blockchain operations aligned with charitable mission values
3. Business Model
Revenue Distribution
5% - Qubic Foundation Development Fund
4% - VPX Team Development
91% - Charitable Causes / Franchisee Share
Revenue Streams
Ticket sales (10,000 QUBIC per ticket)
