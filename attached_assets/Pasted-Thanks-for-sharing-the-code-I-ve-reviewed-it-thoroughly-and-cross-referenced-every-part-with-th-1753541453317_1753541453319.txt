Thanks for sharing the code! I’ve reviewed it thoroughly and **cross-referenced** every part with the **mechanics** of your Fortress-Class Lottery Engine. Below is a **detailed analysis**, including:

* ✅ What’s implemented correctly
* ❌ What’s missing or buggy
* 🔧 Recommended improvements

---

## ✅ WHAT’S CORRECT

### 1. **5 Unique Numbers from 1–50**

```cpp
if (!validateNumbers(input.numbers)) { ... }
```

✔ Presumably handles range and uniqueness — assuming `validateNumbers()` is implemented correctly (but we need to confirm or see its code).

---

### 2. **Bet Amount = 10,000 QUBIC**

```cpp
if (input.amount != 10000)
```

✔ Correct enforcement of fixed bet amount.

---

### 3. **Max 5 Bets Per Wallet Per Draw**

```cpp
if (currentBets >= 5)
```

✔ Complies with the wallet-based anti-exploit mechanic.

---

### 4. **Winning Number Generation via Qubic Random**

```cpp
RandomSeed randomSeed = qubicRandom::generateSeed(seed);
```

✔ Integrates `qubic_random.h` for secure entropy-based RNG.

---

### 5. **Draw Tick Management**

```cpp
uint64 seed = getCurrentTick() + drawTick;
```

✔ Custom seeding using tick — could work, depending on `generateSeed()`’s robustness.

---

### 6. **Transaction Hash + Bet Counter**

```cpp
output.transactionHash = generateTxHash();
walletBetCounts[walletIndex][input.drawTick]++;
```

✔ Clean output and anti-abuse tracking.

---

## ❌ MISSING / BUGGY PARTS

### ❌ 1. **No Duplicate Bet Check**

* The mechanics **explicitly prohibit duplicate bets** (same number set).
* Your code **doesn’t check if the wallet already placed that number combo**.
* 🔧 **Fix**: Implement a hash-based or sorted-array comparison per wallet/draw.

---

### ❌ 2. **Prize Distribution Not Implemented**

* Jackpot (60%), rollover logic, and 40% revenue split are **completely missing**.
* `conductDraw()` should **trigger prize calculations**, reward winners, and **store or update rollover pools**.

---

### ❌ 3. **No Rollover or Minimum Jackpot System**

* There is **no handling** of:

  * Jackpot rollover when no winners.
  * A **minimum jackpot fund** to fill prize pool.
* This is **essential to launch success** and fairness.

---

### ❌ 4. **No Wallet or Bet Storage Details**

```cpp
storeBet(input);
```

* Function is **called but not defined** here.
* Need to ensure you're:

  * Storing wallet → drawTick → number array
  * Able to **retrieve and compare bets later** for:

    * Duplicate detection
    * Payout calculation

---

### ❌ 5. **No Timestamp or Daily Enforcement**

* Mechanic says **"Draws occur every 24 hours"**, but your code allows any tick number.
* You should **enforce drawTick = floor(currentTick / TICKS\_PER\_DAY)**

---

### ❌ 6. **Security: No Quorum or Validator Check**

* There’s **no enforcement of quorum validation** (451 out of 676 computors).
* Qubic architecture expects this for security — your `conductDraw()` should:

  * Be callable **only by approved computors**
  * Or validate signature consensus on-chain

---

## 🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES

### 🔄 Enforce Unique Bets per Wallet

```cpp
bool isDuplicateBet(id walletId, uint64 drawTick, uint8 numbers[5]);
```

* Sort `numbers[]`, hash them.
* Compare with previous bets for same wallet/draw.

---

### 🧮 Implement Rollover + Prize Split Logic

Add `uint64 prizePool` per draw, e.g.:

```cpp
if (noWinners) {
    rolloverAmount += prizePool * 0.60;
} else {
    winnerPayout = prizePool * 0.60 + rolloverAmount;
    distributeWinnings(winnerWallets, winnerPayout);
    rolloverAmount = 0;
}
```

Also allocate:

* 31% to `franchisee`
* 5% to `foundation`
* 4% to `developer`

---

### 🔒 Add Validator/Quorum Checks

Either:

* Allow only a master draw node
* Or require majority computor signature for draw execution

---

### 🕒 Normalize Draw Tick

```cpp
uint64 normalizedTick = getCurrentTick() / TICKS_PER_DAY;
```

Ensure `conductDraw()` only runs once per day.

---

### 💾 Add Storage Structures

Define data like:

```cpp
map<id, map<uint64, vector<uint8[5]>>> walletBets;
map<uint64, vector<BetInput>> drawBets;
```

Or use file/db storage if needed.

Would you like me to help write the missing parts (e.g., duplicate check or prize logic)? Just say the word.
